Project Tasks allow to record time spent, but some activities, such as
Field Service, often require you to keep a record of the materials spent.

This module extends project_task_material module to consume products spent in
a task and create analytic lines to manage costs and create invoices.

Configuration
=============

#. If you are a project manager, go to Project > Configuration > Stages and
   check option 'Consume Material' in Task Stage to generate a stock move when
   the task is in that stage.
#. Go to your user settings and enable option "Manage multiple Stock Locations"
   if you want to manage locations on consuming materials.
#. Go to your user settings and enable option "Analytic Accounting" if you want
   to manage analytic accounts in tasks.

Usage
=====

#. Go to a task, edit, and add materials to be consumed on tab "Materials".
#. Move task to an stage where "Consume material" check is activated and moves
   and analytic lines will be created.
#. You can define default locations to consume material in tasks and projects.
   Locations preference order to consume materials is: locations set in tasks
   first, locations defined in project second and finally standard locations.
#. If you define an analytic account in task, move created will be assigned to
   this analytic account. If not account analytic is defined, then move created
   will be assigned to the analytic account defined in its project.
