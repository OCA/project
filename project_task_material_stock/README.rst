===========================
Project Task Material Stock
===========================

Project Tasks allow to record time spent, but some activities, such as
Field Service, often require you to keep a record of the materials spent.

This module extends project_task_material module to consume products spent in
a task and create analytic lines to manage costs and create invoices.

Configuration
=============

#. If you are a project manager, go to Project > Configuration > Stages and
   check option 'Consume Material' in Task Stage to generate a stock move when
   the task is in that stage.
#. Go to your user settings and enable option "Manage multiple stock_locations"
   if you want to manage locations on consuming materials.

Usage
=====

#. Go to a task, edit, and add materials to be consumed on tab "Materials".
#. Move task to an stage where "Consume material" check is activated and moves
   and analytic lines will be created.
#. You can define default locations to consume material in tasks and projects.
   Locations preference order to consume materials is: locations set in tasks
   first, locations defined in project second and finally standard locations.
