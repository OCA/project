This module adds the behavior to change the Personal Stage of the task to the first
Closed or Folded (Closed Personal Stages has high priority than Folded) stage when
the task reachs an Stage marked as Closed Stage.
If there's a folded personal stage with the same name as the folded shared stage,
that one will be used.
If the Personal Stage is already Folded, does nothing.
Only applies to the Personal Stage of the User that Closes the task.
Simplifies the behavior of closing a task and then go back to Personal Stages
and move it to the Pesonal Done stage.
