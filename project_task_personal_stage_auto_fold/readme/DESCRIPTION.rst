When you close a task, its personal stage will change as well.

This module simplifies to close or to cancel a task from the project stage
and the personal stage.

In the case a task is assigned to more than one user,
only the personal task stage of the user will be updated.

Notice: This module don't change the project task stage from the personal task stage.
It is intended so no change about this functionality is desired or required.
Furthermore, also is intended that only the personal stage of the user who finish
the task with the project task stage will be update. So the other users assigned to
the task have to update the personal task stage manually when they finish it
