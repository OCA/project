What is a Business Requirement?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Business requirement (BR) is the expression of a business need by a customer 
or internal project user. 
A BR can contain multiple different parts depending on the company needs:

* Customer Story: this is the requirement as expressed by the customer
* Scenario: How/where the current solution can provide a suitable scenario to 
  answer the customer story
* Gap: For the uncovered part of the scenario, elaborate the gap/need for specific 
  developments/setup
* Deliverables to be provided to the customer/user
* Resources necessary to achieve the deliverables
* Additional information (approval, cost control etc.)

These modules were originally designed for the service/IT industry but the 
requirement management is generic and can apply to many cases/industries (customer 
or internal projects):

* Construction
* Trading (New product development)
* Business Consultancy
* IT development

What is the difference between a BR and CRM lead?

* CRM leads are sales oriented
* BR are project and workload estimation oriented

How to use this module?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module improves the cost control of the original module with the following:

* Estimation sales price on resource lines. It provides a simple way to 
  calculate the sales price of the deliverable based on the necessary 
  resources lines (see usage).
* Adds ACL for sales price and resource cost confidentiality.
* Creates a tab Cost control in the Business Requirement for simple Gross Profit
  control.
* Multi-currency compatible: sales price is valued at currency Pricelist and 
  converted back to the reporting company currency for the cost control.

Installation
============

No specific steps required

Configuration
=============

Estimation Pricelist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define the Estimation price list in the Master Project which will be 
used in deliverable lines and sales price for the resource lines.


Usage
=====

#. In the BR, you can add as many deliverable lines as necessary. You can keep the price empty at that stage

#. Once the deliverable lines are created you can create as many resources lines as necessary in each DL. 

#. in RL, the estimation sales price will be display per resource

#. The total Revenue from the resource can be copied back to the deliverable line.

#. you can review the cost control tab of your BR as followed (only available for ACL Cost Control)
