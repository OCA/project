This module allows to define which task fields can be modified only by
project managers. If a regular project user tries to modify restricted
field access error will be raised. "You cannot modify field!" This
restriction can be bypassed for tasks that were initially created by the
same user.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you need to restrict modification of certain fields of the
project tasks by internal users. Eg only project manages can add/remove
task tags and change task priority.

Configuration
=============

Go to the "Project/Configuration/Settings" and scroll to the "Task
Management" section. 

Add fields in the "Restricted Fields" field. Enable "Bypass for Task
Creator" if you want to allow task creator to modify restricted fields.

Usage
=====

When user who is not a project manager tries to update restricted fields
