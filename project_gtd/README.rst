Project gtd
==============

This module implements a simple personal to-do list based on tasks. It adds an
editable list of tasks simplified to the minimum required fields in the project
application.

The to-do list is based on the *Getting Things Done* methodology. This
world-wide used methodology is used for personal time management improvement.

*Getting Things Done* (commonly abbreviated as *GTD*) is an action management
method created by David Allen, and described in a book of the same name.

*GTD* rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind
by recording them externally. That way, the mind is freed from the job of
remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually
performing those tasks.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to `Project / Configuration / GTD / Timeboxes` to configure your timeboxes.
#. Here, your new timebox is empty and not visible yet. You need to add tasks in it to make it visible.
#. Go to `Project / Tasks` and edit a task to set the 'Timebox' field.
#. Now go to `Project / Tasks (GTD)` to drag and drop your tasks between timeboxes.
