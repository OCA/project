===================
Project Stage State
===================

This module restores the `state` fields to Project Stages, removed in Odoo 8.0.

For some use cases it‘s necessary to be able to map the multiple Stages into
a few broad groups.

For example, this can allow to define automated actions and business logic for
Tasks not yet “Started”, knowing that “Started” means different Stages in
different Projects.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Project -> Configuration -> Stages and click on a stage
#. Select the state you would like to associate that stage with from the dropdown "State" menu
#. Save your changes
#. Go to Project -> Dashboard and click on a project
#. Click on task in the stage you just edited
#. Under the "Extra Info" tab, you can see the "State" field for that task
