This is a technical module for adding some HR information to projects and
provide technical fields with HR information:

- Employee categories at project and task level.
- Employee linked to the user assigned to a task.
- Employee categories at user level.

These fields can be used later for extra features like task scheduling or
security restrictions.

It also provides some facilities on project management:

* Limit selection of assigned users according selected employee category at
  task level.
* Limit selection of employee categories at task level depending on the
  selected categories at project level. All are shown if no categories at
  project level.

Configuration
=============

For setting employee categories at project level:

#. Go to *Project > Projects*.
#. Click on the 3 vertical dots of one of the project kanban cards for
   unfolding options and select "Edit".
#. Put the wanted employee categories on the field "Employee Categories".

For setting employee categories:

#. Go to *Project > All Tasks*.
#. Select or create a new task.
#. Put the wanted employee categories on the field "Employee categories".
#. If there's already some employee categories selected at project level, those
   will be the only selectable ones in the task.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Project > Search > Tasks*.
#. If there's an employee category selected in the task, you will only be able
   to select those users whose employee belongs to that category.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Limit project and task visibility according employee categories through
  overriding security methods (as through record rules is not possible without
  modifying existing ones).
