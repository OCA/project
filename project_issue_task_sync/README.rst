=====================
Sync Issues and Tasks
=====================

This module syncs assigned user and state from task to issue and viceversa.
If a task is created and does not have a issue a related issue will be
generated. Projects may or may not have this syncing function, the activation
of sync between issues and task may be activated on the project form by
selecting the checkbox "sync issues and tasks". By default projects that use
tasks and issues will be synced.
