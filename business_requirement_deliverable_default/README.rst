What is a Business Requirement?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Business requirement (BR) is the expression of a business need by a customer 
or internal project user. 
A BR can contain multiple different parts depending on the company needs:

* Customer Story: this is the requirement as expressed by the customer
* Scenario: How/where the current solution can provide a suitable scenario to 
  answer the customer story
* Gap: For the uncovered part of the scenario, elaborate the gap/need for specific 
  developments/setup
* Deliverables to be provided to the customer/user
* Resources necessary to achieve the deliverables
* Additional information (approval, cost control etc.)

These modules were originally designed for the service/IT industry but the 
requirement management is generic and can apply to many cases/industries (customer 
or internal projects):

* Construction
* Trading (New product development)
* Business Consultancy
* IT development

What is the difference between a BR and CRM lead?

* CRM leads are sales oriented
* BR are project and workload estimation oriented

How to use this module?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module adds the following features to the deliverable modules:

* Possibility to create default resource lines for a given product. This allows
  the user to have standard resource lines uploaded in the BR for deliverable 
  packages.

Installation
============

No specific steps required

Configuration
=============

Users
^^^^^

No special ACL set up

Default resources in Deliverable Product
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create Deliverable products and add in them standard resource lines
expected to be added in the Business requirement by default.
Depending on the modules you are using for the business requirements, the 
content of the resources lines will reflect the expected resources lines in the 
BR.

On product_template view add a new tab "Resources" with the resource lines management (You could add, delete or create new resources).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Currently prices are not updated when the resource lines are uploaded in the 
  BR. => Add a button to recalculate Sales estimation prices in the Deliverable 
  line
