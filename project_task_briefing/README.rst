When using task work and task materials, the first tab gets too crowded.
This module places the Description field in a new initial tab titled 
"Briefing": it is expected to be used as an initial the description of
the work to be done.

Roadmap
=======

* Add a "debriefing" tab: it would be useful to also have a debriefing field
  to report on the work done and results.
