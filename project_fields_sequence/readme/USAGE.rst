To use this module, it is necessary to:

#. Create one or more sequences in which your code starts with ``project.field.``
   and then concatenate the name of the field that its type is *Character*.
   E.g.: ``project.field.name`` or ``project.field.alias_name``.
#. Create a project.
#. Check that the field defined in the sequence is set to the next value in the sequence.
