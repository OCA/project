To configure this module, you need to:

#. Create one or more sequences in which your code starts with ``project.field.``
   and then concatenate the name of the field that its type is *Character*.
   You can check the field name activating the developer mode on settings and
   then put the cursor over the desired field.
   The first line of the pop-up will show the field name.
#. Configure as many sequences as you want.
