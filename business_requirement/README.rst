What is a Business Requirement?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Business requirement (BR) is the expression of a business need by a customer 
or internal project user. 
A BR can contain multiple different parts depending on the company needs:

* Customer Story: this is the requirement as expressed by the customer
* Scenario: How/where the current solution can provide a suitable scenario to 
  answer the customer story
* Gap: For the uncovered part of the scenario, elaborate the gap/need for specific 
  developments/setup
* Deliverables to be provided to the customer/user
* Resources necessary to achieve the deliverables
* Additional information (approval, cost control etc.)

These modules were originally design for the service/IT industry but the 
requirement management is generic and can apply to many cases/industries (customer 
or internal projects):

* Construction
* Trading (New product development)
* Business Consultancy
* IT development

What is the difference between a BR and CRM lead?

* CRM leads are sales oriented
* BR are project and workload estimation oriented

How to use this module?
