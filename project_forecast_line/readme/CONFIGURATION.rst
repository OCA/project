In the settings, you'll find a Forecast Management section where you can configure

* the granularity of the forecast (day / week / month)
* the horizon of the forecast (number of months)
* if we want to manage forecast from quotations

Then you can configure in the Forecast application the forecast roles. These are
roles than can be linked to products and to employees, for instance "project
manager" or "consultant".

If you want to use the forecast on sales -> forecast on tasks chain, you should
configure the service products that will be used on the sale order to give them
a forecast role.

Finally, you need to set roles on employees. You can set this on the Jobs, and
when an employee is assigned a job, the job's role will be pushed to the
employee. Or you can just set the role on the employee. The roles of employees
have start and end dates, so you can manage people who will join the company in
the future or people's internal job changes. You can also set a rate and handle
people wearing multiple hats.
