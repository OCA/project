This module implements "Project Internal Collaborators". These users
have readonly access to projects where they are added as collaborators
and tasks they are following in such projects. Only users who have
"Project/User" group can be added as collaborators. Collaborators can be
added to and removed from projects both manually and automatically.

NB: if user is already a project follower this user will not be added as
an internal collaborator automatically.

Use Cases / Context
===================

To have access to an "On invitation only" project user must be added as
a follower to such project. However this will also subscribe him to all
tasks of the project. Which is not what is needed sometimes. Odoo has
its own internal mechanism for "Collaborators". However it requires a
project to be shared.

Configuration
=============

Go to the "Project/Configuration/Settings" and scroll to the "Task
Management" section.

Enable "Add Internal Collaborators on Task Assigned" to add users as
collaborators when user is assigned to a task in a project. Enable "Add
Internal Collaborators on Activity Assigned" to add users as
collaborators when user is assigned an activity to a task in a project.

You can also add internal collaborators to projects manually. To do this
open a project and add users to the "Collaborators" field located next
to the "Project Manager" field.

Usage
=====

If "Add Internal Collaborators on Task Assigned" is enabled users will
be added as internal collaborators to projects when they are assigned to
a task. If a user is no longer assigned to any task is a project such
user will be automatically removed from the internal collaborators.

If "Add Internal Collaborators on Activity Assigned" is enabled users
will be added as internal collaborators to projects when they are
assigned to a task. If a user has no activities left in a project and is
no longer assigned to any task is the project such user will be
automatically removed from the internal collaborators.
