This module implements "Project Internal Collaborators". These users have readonly access to projects where they are added as collaborators and tasks they are following in such projects.
Only users who have "Project/User" group can be added as collaborators.
Collaborators can be added to and removed from projects both manually and automatically.

NB: if user is already a project follower this user will not be added as an internal collaborator automatically.
