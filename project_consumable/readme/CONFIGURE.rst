To be able to track consumable products (or avoid to link un-followed
products) to project, you have to configure each products to
be available in projects.

#. Go to Product form view (ie: *Invoicing > customers > Products*)
   and make sure the `project_ok` field is checked (by default consumable
   products are available).

.. note::

    This module do not depends on sales or accounting modules so you may
    need to install  extra modules to get menu entry to products or
    analytic account line views.
