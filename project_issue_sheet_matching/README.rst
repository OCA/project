================================
Project Issue Timesheet Matching
================================

When timesheet lines are read in from an external source, eg. through the Toggl 
connector, they are not connected to a project issue. 

This module allows to match timesheet lines to issues.

Usage
=====

To use this module, go to Human Resources - Timesheet issue matching and match timesheet lines to issues.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The number of timesheet lines still to be matched is displayed in the menu, but also appears
  on other menu items leading to timesheet line views.
* We should find a way to be able to dismiss lines that you don't want to match to an issue.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/hr_timesheet/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smash it by providing detailed and welcomed feedback.
