To define risks for your projects:

#. Go to *Project > Search > Risks*;
#. create a new risk;
#. the rating is automatically calculated based on this risk matrix:
    .. image:: ../static/description/matrix.png
       :alt: Risk matrix
#. set the state to 'Active' if the risk is in effect;
#. set the state to 'Closed' if the risk is processed or e.g. completely avoided.

The list of risks is by default ordered by rating and proximity.
Risks with a rating higher than rating 'Medium-High' become red.
