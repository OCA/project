Configuration
=============

This module provides a number of default risk categories, but you can add more at *Project > Configuration > Risk Categories*.
For risk response categories you need to go to *Project > Configuration > Risk Response Categories*.

Usage
=====

To define risks for your projects:

#. Go to *Project > Search > Risks*;
#. create a new risk;
#. the rating is automatically calculated based on this risk matrix:
    .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/project/11.0/project_risk/static/description/matrix.png
       :alt: Risk matrix
#. set the state to 'Active' if the risk is in effect;
#. set the state to 'Closed' if the risk is processed or e.g. completely avoided.

The list of risks is by default ordered by rating and proximity.
Risks with a rating higher than rating 'Medium-High' become red.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Create a task based on a risk response: it would be nice if a task can automatically be created based on the risk response information.
