This module extends functionality of the project_task_pull_request module. It adds a
"State" field to Task alongside with PR URI field.

Following pre-defined states are available: "Draft", "Open", "Merged", "Closed". You can
add or modify this list easily by overriding the "selection_pr_state" function in the
"project.task" model

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module is designed as a basis for further automation based on the pull
request state of the task. For example one can use webhooks to set PR state
in the task when it is updated in the GitHub. And use automated actions afterwards
to update task status, assign and activity or do any other related actions.

Configuration
=============

#. In General Settings -> Project -> Project Task Pull Request section select default PR
   State for all tasks

To define custom default PR state for particular project:

#. Select project -> Open "Settings" -> Set "Default PR State"
