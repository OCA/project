This module extends the name_search() and name_get() methods of the project.task model
to search for, and display the ID of the task in the name field.

This module will simplify your operations if they heavily rely on the task ID. For
instance, you can select a task by its ID when creating a timesheet record.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

The task's display name will change to a concatenation of its ID and task name (e.g., [ID] task_name).
You can search for the task using its ID in the Many2one field or in the search view.
