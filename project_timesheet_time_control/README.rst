Usage
=====

You can access via timesheets:

#. Go to *Timesheets > Timesheet > All Timesheets*.
#. Create a new record.
#. You will see now that the "Date" field contains also time information.
#. If you don't select any "project", you will be able to select any "task",
   opened or not.
#. Selecting a "task", the corresponding "project" is filled.
#. Selecting a "project", tasks are filtered for only allow
   to select opened tasks for that project. Remember that an opened task is
   a task whose stage doesn't have "Closed" mark checked.
#. At the end of the line, you will see an stop button.
#. When you press this button, the difference between "Date" field and the
   current time, writing this in the field "Duration".
#. You can modify the "Date" field for altering the computation of the
   duration.

Or via tasks:

#. Go to Project > Search > Tasks.
#. Click on one existing task or create a new one.
#. On the "Timesheets" page, you will be able to handle records the same way
   as you do in the above explanation (except the task selection part, which
   in this case doesn't appear as it's the current one).
