Allow to track the exact moment when a timesheet line is started (not
only the day, but also the minute and second) and let users start and
stop timers easily.

Installation
============

This module depends on modules found in these repositories:

-  `OCA/timesheet <https://github.com/OCA/timesheet>`__
-  `OCA/web <https://github.com/OCA/web>`__

Usage
=====

You can access via timesheets:

1.  Go to *Timesheets > Timesheet > All Timesheets*.
2.  Create a new record.
3.  You will see now that the *Date* field contains also time
    information.
4.  If you don't select any "project", you will be able to select any
    "task", opened or not.
5.  Selecting a "task", the corresponding "project" is filled.
6.  Selecting a "project", tasks are filtered for only allow to select
    opened tasks for that project. Remember that an opened task is a
    task whose stage doesn't have "Closed" mark checked.
7.  At the end of the line, you will see a stop button.
8.  When you press this button, the difference between *Date* field and
    the current time is saved in the "Duration" field.
9.  You can modify the *Date* field for altering the computation of the
    duration.
10. After a record is stopped, you see a *Resume* button, which will
    open a wizard that inherits all relevant values from that timesheet
    line and lets you duplicate it to indicate you start working in the
    same thing.
11. If you didn't stop the timer, but still hit *Resume* in any other,
    the wizard will tell you that you have a running timer and that
    starting a new one will stop the other one that is running.

To access the wizard directly:

1. Go to *Timesheet > Timesheet > Start work*.
2. You will be able to enter a new timesheet line from scratch, but by
   using this wizard, you avoid problems with old or duplicate running
   timers.

Or via projects:

1. Go to *Project > Projects*.
2. If a project has a running timesheet line, it will display a *Stop*
   button.
3. Other projects that have enabled timesheets will display a *Start*
   button that will open the same wizard as the timesheet lines, but
   duplicating project's last timesheet line without a task.
4. You can see the same in list and form views.

Or via tasks:

1. Go to *Project > All Tasks*.
2. If a task has a running timesheet line, it will display a *Stop*
   button.
3. Other tasks that have enabled timesheets will display a *Start*
   button that will open the same wizard as the timesheet lines,
   duplicating task's last timesheet line.
4. You can see the same in list view.
5. Click on any existing task or create a new one.
6. You can see the same feature in the action buttons box.
7. On the *Timesheets* page, you will be able to handle records the same
   way as you do in the above explanation (except the task selection
   part, which in this case doesn't appear as it's the current one).

Note: All the *Start/Resume/Stop* features are disabled if you don't
belong to the *Timesheets/User* group or if you are viewing a timesheet
that belongs to another user.
