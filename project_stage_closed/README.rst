=========================
Project Task Stage Closed
=========================

Odoo provides a 'closed' flag on project task stages, but this flag
is in the sale_service module, which in turns pulls a lot of dependencies
such as sale, accounting, and procurement. In many circumstances,
it is desirable to have such a flag to indicate a task is closed,
without needing so many dependencies.

This module provides the flag in a way that is compatible with sale_service
but depending only on the project module.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Activate developer mode.
#. Go to *Project > Configuration > Stages*.
#. You have the "Closed" flag available to be checked on the form view.
