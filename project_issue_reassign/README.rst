The Responsible (``user_id``) field is made read only, and can instead be
changed through a wizard, accessible only to Project Users.

Regular users (Employee group) will be able to see who is handling the request,
but won't be able to change it.

Project Users can click on the "=> Reassign" link, in front of the current
responsible, to open a dialog where they can select the new responsible and/or
new Project/Service Team it should be assigned to.

Mass reassignments can also be made, through the context menu action on the
Issues list view.
